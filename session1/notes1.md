## Discussion 1: Define Leadership

|Period|Definition|
|-|-|
|1900-1929|Control and centralization of power with a common theme of domination.|
|1930s|Emerging view that leadership is influence rather than domination. Interaction of individual's personality with those of a group.|
|1940s|Behavior of an individual while involved in directing group activities. Leadership by persuasion distinguished from leadership by coercion.|
|1950s|Leaders in groups; relationship that develops shared goals; effectiveness|
|1960s|Behavior that influences people towards shared goals|
|1970s|Group focus changed to organization behavior; leadership views as initiating and maintaining groups or organizations to accomplish goals|
|1980s|Getting followers to do what the leader wants; noncoercive influence; leadership traits; leadership occurs when leaders and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morality|
|21st Century|Emphasize the process of leadership: authentic leadership, spiritual leadership (laedership that utilizes values and a sense of calling to motivate), servant leadership (leader utilizes caring principles), adaptive leadership|

> Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.

## Discussion 2: Power in the Workplace

> According to the text there are five types of power in the workplace: legitimate, reward, coercive, expert, and referent power. Each type of power is dependent on the followers or subordinates belief. If the follower does not hold the requisite belief, the leader is not able to influence them. What type of belief must the leader create for each type of power to be effective?

**assigned leadership** - leadership based on occupying a position in an organization is assigned leadership
**emergent leadership** - when others perceive an individual as the most influential member of a group or organization, regardless of title or experience

* emergent leaders:
    * are verbally involved
    * are always informed
    * seek others’ opinions
    * initiate new ideas
    * are firm but not rigid

> A unique perspective on leadership emergence is provided by social identity theory (Hogg, 2001). From this perspective, leadership emergence is the degree to which a person fits with the identity of the group as a whole. As groups develop over time, a group prototype also develops. Individuals emerge as leaders in the group when they become most like the group pro- totype. Being similar to the prototype makes leaders attractive to the group and gives them influence with the group.

## Discussion 3: Assigned vs. Emergent Leaders

> Explain the differences between assigned and emergent leaders. Give an example of an instance in which you “emerged” as a leader. Explain how your traits, behavior and communication skills might have facilitated your emergence as leader. Compare that to an instance in which you were assigned a leadership role. Discuss the differences in these experiences.

Emergent Leadership. Current role where I am using my expertise and ability to learn quickly to become the goto expert on a topic. This expertise is allowing me to make design decisions, even though those are a bit above what I should be doing in my first job. Showing an aptitude and having interest gives other people more confidence in you making the right choice because they'll know you thought about it.

In my last role, I was in charge of a team within a team. But my position was superceeded by those around me. It was hard to make changes within my team because the other people on my team didn't want to work towards a common goal. They rather just complain and not make changes.

## Notes

> The overriding function of management is to provide order and consistency to organizations, whereas the primary function of leadership is to produce change and movement.

## Lecture

* Pay attention to historical perspective of when the book was written
