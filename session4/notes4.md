## Discussion 2: Safeguarding Against Failure

According the path-goal theory of leadership, the leader has three major responsibilities: clarify the path so subordinates know which way to go, remove roadblocks that are stopping them from getting there, and increase the rewards along the route. This approach assumes that there is one right way of achieving a goal and that the leader can see it and the follower cannot. This approach can be extremely successful or dreadfully disastrous. What safe guards might an organization or leader take in order to safeguard against failures? Have you witnessed this approach to leadership? What was the result?

## Discussion 3: Discussion: The Contingency Theory

Explain how the contingency theory shifted the focus from static leadership traits, skills, and behaviors to a leader’s ability to evolve based on situational variables.
