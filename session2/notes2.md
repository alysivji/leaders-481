## Chapter 15: Gender and Leadership

> Women are no less effective at leading than men, and women are no less committed to their jobs or motivated for leadership roles than men. However, women are less likely to self-promote and negotiate than men. Furthermore, research shows a small gender difference such that women are more likely to focus on the welfare of others and ethical behavior.

> Women who make up a very small minority of a male-dominated group are seen as tokens representing all women; they experience signifi- cant pressure as their highly visible performance is scrutinized, and they are perceived through gender-stereotyped lenses

In tech, working from home is an attractive option for both men and women. Not sure I'd say women especially because everybody hates commuting, but having a more flexible schedule definitely is preferred by women vs men.

> Research on gender and leadership focuses on decreasing the gender gap in leadership positions, thereby lessening gender segregation at work; how- ever, the leadership gap will not be closed without a concurrent focus on closing the gender gap at home.

## Chapter 16: Culture and Leadership

> Fourth, the GLOBE studies provide useful information about what is uni- versally accepted as good and bad leadership. Clearly, people from most cultures view good leadership as based on integrity, charisma, and interper- sonal ability. Conversely, they see bad leadership emerging from leaders who are self-focused, dictatorial, and asocial. These lists of positive and negative attributes provide a useful portrait of how people around the world concep- tualize leadership.
