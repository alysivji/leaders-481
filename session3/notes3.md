* Explain the difference between a “skill” and a “trait."
* Identify individual leadership competencies by completing the “Skills Inventory.”

## Discussion 1: Emotional and Social Intelligence Test

We all have been reading and discussing these two topics. It seems, we all agree that both are not quite different from each other. While researching , I came across following two tests that I wanted to share :

* [Social Intelligence Test](http://kgajos.eecs.harvard.edu/mite/)
* [Emotional Intelligence Test](http://psychology.about.com/library/quiz/bl_eq_quiz.htm)

## Discussion 2: Skills vs. Process Based Approach to Leadership

## Discussion 3: Emotional vs. Social Intelligence

Compare the traits of emotional intelligence and social intelligence. How are they the same? Different? Can a person possess one of these traits without the other? Explain your answer.

## Discussion 4: Perceptions of Leadership

Why do people’s perceptions of leaders matter? How does perception fit with the process nature of leadership? How does it fit with the influential nature of leadership?

## Chapter 2: Trait Approach

* "Great Man" theory

> the trait approach is alive and well. It began with an emphasis on identifying the qualities of great persons, shifted to include the impact of situations on leadership, and, currently, has shifted back to reemphasize the critical role of traits in effective leadership.

Stogdill identified leadership traits that showed how leaders were different from the average group memeber in the following eight traits: intelligence, alertness, insight, responsibility, initiative, persistence, self-confidence, and socialbility

> The findings of Stogdill’s first survey also indicated that an individual does not become a leader solely because that individual possesses certain traits. Rather, the traits that leaders possess must be relevant to situations in which the leader is functioning.

### Studies of Leadership Traits and Characteristics

|Paper|Traits|
|-|-|
|Stogdill (1948)|* intelligence * alertness * insight * responsibility * initiative * persistence * self-confidence * sociability|
|Mann (1959)|* intelligence * masculinity * adjustment * dominance * extraversion * conservatism|
|Stogdill (1974)|* achievement * persistence * insight * initiative * self-confidence * responsibility * cooperativeness * tolerance * influence * sociability|
|Lord, DeVader, and Alliger (1986)|* intelligence * masculinity * dominance|
|Kirkpatrick and Locke (1991)|* drive * motivation * integrity * confidence * cognitive ability * task knowledge|
|Zaccaro, Kemp, and Bader (2004)|* cognitive abilities * extraversion * conscientiousness * emotional stability * openness * agreeableness * motivation * social intelligence * self-monitoring * emotional intelligence * problem solving|

### Big Five Personality Factors

|Trait|Manifestation|
|-|-|
|Neuroticism|The tendency to be depressed, anxious, insecure, vulnerable, and hostile|
|Extraversion|The tendency to be sociable and assertive and to have positive energy|
|Openness|The tendency to be informed, creative, insightful, and curious|
|Agreeableness|The tendency to be accepting, conforming, trusting, and nurturing|
|Conscientiousness|The tendency to be thorough, organized, controlled, dependable, and decisive|

Judge et al. (2002) found a strong relationship between the Big Five traits and leadership.

### Emotional Intelligence

> **emotional intelligence** can be defined as the ability to perceive and express emotions, to use emotions to facilitate thinking, to understand and reason with emotions, and to effectively manage emotions within oneself and in relationships with others

> As a leadership ability or trait, emotional intelligence appears to be an important construct. The underlying premise suggested by this framework is that people who are more sensitive to their emotions and the impact of their emotions on others will be leaders who are more effective. As more research is conducted on emotional intelligence, the intricacies of how emotional intelligence relates to leadership will be better understood.

### Trait Approach

#### How it Work

> The trait approach is very different from the other approaches discussed in subsequent chapters because it focuses exclusively on the leader, not on the followers or the situation. This makes the trait approach theoretically more straightforward than other approaches. In essence, the trait approach is concerned with what traits leaders exhibit and who has these traits.
>
> The trait approach does not lay out a set of hypotheses or principles about what kind of leader is needed in a certain situation or what a leader should do, given a particular set of circumstances. Instead, this approach emphasizes that having a leader with a certain set of traits is crucial to having effective leadership. It is the leader and the leader’s traits that are central to the leadership process.
>
> The trait approach is also used for personal awareness and development. By analyzing their own traits, managers can gain an idea of their strengths and weaknesses, and can get a feel for how others in the organization see them.

#### Strengths

* intuitive
    * built on the premise that leaders are different and their differences reside in the special traits they possess
* century of research to back it up
    * not a great point, but longevity of research lends credibility
* focuses on the leader vs followers or situation
* gives us benchmarks to shoot for

#### Criticisms

* "definite list" of leadership traits
    * LOTS of traits
    * studies have ambiguous / uncertain findings
* doesn't take situation into account
* subjective in how you want to see the traits in leaders
* identified traits without addressing how leadership traits affect group members and their work
* not useful for trainign and development of leaders

## Chapter 3: Skills Approach

* emphasizes skills and abilities that can be learned or developed

* Katz suggested that effective leadership depends on three basic skills:
    * Technical
    * Human
    * Conceptional

* skill are what leaders can accoplish, traits are who leaders are
* can develop these capabilities over time and through education and experience
* suggests that many people have the potential for leadership

> Rather than emphasizing what leaders do, the skills approach frames leadership as the capabilities (knowledge and skills) that make effective leadership possible

### Technical Skills

> Technical skill is knowledge about and proficiency in a specific type of work or activity. It includes competencies in a specialized area, analytical ability, and the ability to use appropriate tools and techniques

* play an essential role in pro- ducing the actual products a company is designed to produce.
* is most important at lower and middle levels of management and less important in upper management

### Human Skill (aka People Skills)

> Human skill is knowledge about and ability to work with people.

* being aware of one’s own perspective on issues and, at the same time, being aware of the perspective of other
* can adapt their ideas to those of others

### Conceptual Skills

> Conceptual skills is the ability to work with ideas and concepts. A leader with conceptual skills is comfortable talking about the ideas that shape an organization and the intricacies involved. He or she is good at putting the company’s goals into words and can understand and express the economic principles that affect the company. A leader with conceptual skills works easily with abstractions and hypothetical notions.

* central to creating a vision and strategic plan for an organization
* mental work of shaping organizational or policy issues
* most important at the top level of management

### Skills Model

* Consists of five components:

#### Competencies

* Problem Solving Skills - creative ability to solve new and unusual, ill-defined organizational problems
    * The skills include being able to define significant problems, gather problem information, formulate new understandings about the problem, and generate prototype plans for problem solutions.

* Social Judgement Skills - capacity to understand people and social systems
    * They enable leaders to work with others to solve problems and to marshal support to implement change within an organization
    * perspective taking - understanding the attitudes that others have towards a particular problem or solution (*empathy applied to problem solving*)
    * social perceptiveness - insight and awareness into how others in the organization function (*pulse on the button*)
    * behavioral flexibility - capacity to change and adapt one's behavior in light of an understanding of others' perspective in the organization (*don't be dogmatic, be open and willing to change*)
    * social performance - based on an understanding of followers' perspectives, be able to communicate their own vision to others (*skills under the communication umbrella*)

* Knowledge - accumulation of information and the mental structures used to organize that information (aka schema)
    * as we organize information into categories, the information becomes more meaningful and knowledge emerges from the facts and organization structures we apply to them
    * make it possible for people to think about complex system issues and identify possible strategies for appropriate change. Furthermore, this capacity allows people to use prior cases and incidents in order to plan for needed change
    * allows people to use the past to constructively confront the future

#### Individual Attributes

* General Cognitive Ability - intelligence
* Crystallized Cognitive Ability - intellectual ability that is learned or acquired over time
* Motivation
* Personality

#### Leadership Outcomes

* Effective Problem Solving
* Performance - how well a leader has done their job

#### Career Experiences

* experiences acquired in the course of leaders’ careers influence their knowl- edge and skills to solve complex problems.
* leaders develop competencies over time

#### Environmental Influences

* factors that lie outside the leader’s competencies, characteristics, and experiences
* can be *internal* and *external*

### How Does Skills Approach Work

* skills approach provides a structure for understanding the nature of effective leadership

* The three-skill approach of Katz suggests that the importance of certain leadership skills varies depending on where leaders are in a management hierarchy

### Strengths

* conceptualizes and creates a structure of the process of leadership around skills
* makes leadership available to everyone
* focus on the many factors captures many of the intricacies and complexities of leadership not found in other models

### Criticisms

* the breadth of the skills approach seems to extend beyond the boundaries of leadership
* weak in predictive value
* this is really a trait model in disguise
* is it applicable outside of the military
